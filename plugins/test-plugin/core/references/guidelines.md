# Plugin Guidelines

## Best Practices

1. Keep commands focused on a single task
2. Use descriptive names
3. Document all arguments
4. Handle errors gracefully

## File Organization

- Commands go in `.claude/commands/`
- Agents go in `.claude/agents/`
- Skills go in `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`
- Hooks go in `hooks/hooks.json`
