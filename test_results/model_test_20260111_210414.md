## Legend

- ✅ Passed - Model completed the task successfully
- ⚠️ Warning - Completed but with errors in output
- ❌ Failed - Model could not complete the task
- ⏰ Timeout - Model took too long (>120s)

## Test Prompts Used

1. **Bash Test**: "List the files in the current directory using bash"
2. **Read Test**: "Read the README.md file and summarize it in 2 sentences"
3. **Bridge Test**: "@cc2oc-bridge run greet"

## Recommendations

Models that passed all tests are recommended for use with cc2oc-bridge.
Models with partial passes may work for simple commands but struggle with complex workflows.
